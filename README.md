# CAD
This project is basically about developing a Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) model using SVM which should measure DTI MRI scans of mood-affected and non-affected individuals suffering from depression and other mental health related diseases.
So in simple terms basically a model for detection of depression.

So if I talk briefly a website will be made...which might ask about various modes to log in like log in as patient or as professional.So if one logs in like a patient then he/she will upload the scan and then the model would provide simple visualisations and information detected from the scan....I mean to say that the UI would be user friendly for the patient and would be relatively more complex for the professionals.We might create a customized dashboard where user can access their previous reports and charts.We can also  suggest some clinical helpline number and stuff like that....That was a brief intro about the website
